"""Imports made my intake when it itself is imported

Since "plugins" are just subclasses of things like intake.readers.readers.BaseReader,
importing them is enough for registration.

To include imports from a package in the list of things to import, the canonical thing
to do is include an entry under "intake.imports" in the package entrypoints; the value
of each item will be imported.

The following config keys define behaviour:

- import_on_startup: if False, makes no automatic imports
- entrypoints_block_list: if an entrypoints import has a top-level package name
  in this list, it will be skipped
- import_extras: values in this list will be imported after processing entrypoints. This is
  a way to include imports without installing packages/entrypoints.
