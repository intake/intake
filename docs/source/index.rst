Intake
======

*Taking the pain out of data access and distribution*

Intake is a lightweight package for finding, investigating, loading and disseminating data. It will appeal to different
groups for some of the reasons below, but is useful for all and acts as a common platform that everyone can use to
smooth the progression of data from developers and providers to users.


:term:`Data User`
-----------------

* Intake loads the data for a range of formats and types (see :ref:`plugin-directory`) into containers you already use,
  like Pandas dataframes, Python lists, NumPy arrays, and more
* Intake loads, and gets out of your way
* GUI, search and introspect data-sets in :term:`Catalogs<Catalog>`: quickly find what you need to do your work
* Install data-sets and automatically get requirements
* Leverage cloud resources and distributed computing.

:term:`Data Provider`
---------------------

* Simple spec to define data sources
* Single point-of truth, no more copy&paste
* Distribute data using packages, shared files or a server
* Update definitions in-place
* Parametrise user options
* Make use of additional functionality like filename parsing and caching.

:term:`IT`
----------

* Create catalogs out of established departmental practices
* Provide data access credentials via Intake parameters
* Use server-client architecture as gatekeeper:

   * add authentication methods
   * add monitoring point; track the data-sets being accessed.

* Hook Intake into proprietary data access systems.

:term:`Developer`
-----------------

* Turn boilerplate code into a reusable :term:`Driver`
* Pluggable architecture of Intake allows for many points to add and improve
* Open, simple code-base, come and get involved on `github`_!
