Examples
========

Here we list links to notebooks and other code demonstrating the use of Intake in various
scenarios. The first section is of general interest to various users, and the sections that
follow tend to be more specific about particular features and workflows.

Many of the entries here include a link to Binder, which a service that lest you execute
code live in a notebook environment. This is a great way to experience using Intake.
It can take a while, sometimes, for Binder to come up, please have patience.

See also the `examples`_ repository, containing data-sets which can be built and installed
as conda packages.
